        h3 Founding story
        p The journey of Vizoo started in 2013 when it was founded by Martin Semsch and Reinhard Meier in the small city of Erlangen, Germany. Both of them were part of the 3D team of a big sportswear brand, and while there were many 3D tools for modelling, simulation and rendering, the two entrepreneurs quickly realized the need for an industrialized solution to capture material surfaces for digital product creation.
        p Hence the idea of the xTex scanner was born and the startup Vizoo was created.
        p After one year of industrial design and programming, the new product was released to the market and quickly found its foothold in the automotive and CGI industry.
        p Three years later, the Fashion industry's interest in 3D started to rise and with it Vizoo became the global solution provider for digital materials.
        p Currently, there are three main offices in Germany and the USA and a dozen partners to help bring the useful technology to companies around the world.
